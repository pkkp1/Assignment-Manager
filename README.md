Assignment Management system was developed by me during my last semester of Diploma in Computer Science and Engineering. The main technology used was ASP.Net with VB.Net, JavaScript, jQuery with AJAX, HTML-CSS-BootStrap. ASP.Net provides synchronous transactions with the server, to make it more efficient, I implemented AJAX using jQuery and file handler(ASHX file). The project was ready for deployment and for use but at the last moment, we didn't get permission for it to be used by our College. The Roles were basically Head of Department, Professors and Students. Where the HoD can add/remove professors, assignments and students. The professors are given all privileges for handling, uploading and checking the assignments. It offers some other functionalities that makes it easy to understand and use. The students can only upload the given assignment and view it before 
 and after the submission. To implement authentication, I have used the concept of salt with Hashing.
